# TechnicalSupportLibrary

A library intended to improve technical support while running SAPUI5 applications.

While running and the support is enabled through the library we want to enable the application to log:

* The full URL used to access the application
* The arguments that were used while calling a method
* The SAPUI5 log entries
* The SAPUI5 model data present at the time of the error
* The exception description
